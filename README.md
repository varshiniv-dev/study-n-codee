Tiny codes, small ideas, creative builds - a growing collection of experiments.

#Code Experiments Collection

Tiny codes. Small ideas. Creative builds.  
This repository is a growing garden of experiments shaped through different languages — from patterns to interactive pieces, from tiny utilities to playful logic.

#What's Inside?

• Mini projects, simple programs, visual patterns  
• Practice files from different languages  
• Creative logic mixed with basic programming concepts  
• Experiments that may one day become something bigger

> This space is not about perfection — it’s about trying, creating, and letting ideas sprout.
